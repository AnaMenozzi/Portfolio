# My first portfolio

## What is this project about?

This is the project we developed during the HTML5 and CSS course I took, called "From scratch: HTML and CSS web projects", offered by Alura (https://www.alura.com.br/). While the original class project featured a design created specifically for the course, I made changes to better reflect my personal taste and style.
The goal was to create a personal homepage that introduces someone.

## What is there to see in this project?

The course goal was to build a homepage with a header menu linked to two additional pages.
The homepage serves as a brief introduction to the work, while the 'Sobre mim' button leads to a short self-introduction of the person responsible for the work, and the 'Curr√≠culo' button directs to their resume.
